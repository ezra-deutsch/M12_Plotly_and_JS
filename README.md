# M12_Plotly_and_JS_Belly_Button_Biodiversity - Module 12 - Challenge

### Overview and Purpose

Roza has been tasked with creating a vizualization dashboard to present her findings of bacterial data to Improbable Beef. She has created a dropdown menu to view different subjects along with different charts; bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart, to see the data associated with each subject in different ways. 

### Results
